> **Fly freely through the air with the Boots Lunge enchantment!**

This mod adds a unique new enchantment exclusive to boots, offering two different types of Lunge mechanics.

---

## 🎮 Keybinds (Default)

* **Open Config Screen**: `U`

* **Boots Lunge**: `R`

* **Directional Jump**: `WASD` + `Space` (In Air)

* **Quick Directional Jump**: `Ctrl` + `WASD` + `Space`

* **Emergency Brake**: `Shift` + `Space`


---

## ⚡ Basic Rules

* **Usage Limit**: The maximum consecutive uses depend on the enchantment level (`Level + 1` uses).


* **Count Reset**: Landing on the ground completely resets your usage count.


* **Environmental Resistance**: Propulsion force is reduced in water, lava, and powder snow.


* **No Resource Cost**: Does **not** consume item durability or food/saturation levels.

## 🚀 Lunge Modes & Features

### 1. Boots Lunge

* **Trigger**: Press the **Lunge Key** (`R` by default).


* **Behavior**: Lunges directly toward the direction your player is currently looking, regardless of your state or ground contact.
---

### 2. Directional Jump

* **Trigger**: Press the **Jump Key** while holding movement keys in midair.


* **Behavior**: Lunges in the direction of your movement keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) without changing your camera orientation. If no movement keys are pressed, you will lunge vertically upward.


* **Note**: Since this only triggers while off the ground, press the Jump key twice from the ground (e.g., hold `S` and double-tap `Space` to quickly leap backward).

> ⛔ **Restriction**: Cannot be used while equipping an Elytra (regardless of whether you are actively gliding or not).
---

### 3. Quick Directional Jump

* **Trigger**: Press `Ctrl` + **Jump Key** (`Space`).


* **Behavior**: Works like Directional Jump, but can be activated **instantly from the ground** without needing to be midair first.

> ⛔ **Restriction**: Cannot be used while airborne if an Elytra is equipped.
---

### 4. Emergency Brake

* **Trigger**: Press `Shift` + **Jump Key** (`Space`).


* **Behavior**: When falling from high altitudes, standard lunge propulsion might not fully counter your downward momentum. The Emergency Brake cancels your vertical velocity, applying a hard brake in midair.

> ⛔ **Restriction**: Cannot be used while equipping an Elytra (regardless of whether you are actively gliding or not).
